## Project Title
Research project on Autonomous Routing and Connection of Multi-Core Cables into Prefabricated Walls.

## Project Description
The demand for affordable housing is increasing rapidly. Driven by high labour costs, home
prices are climbing ever higher. Therefore, some new methods are introduced to reduce
construction costs. A solution is the automatic pre-fabrication of homes, improving construction
efficiency in terms of time and labour cost. This project focuses on automating the handling
and routing of electrical cables in pre-fabricated walls, employing a sophisticated robotic
end-effector, a path planning scheme to appropriately control the robot arm, and specially
designed connector solutions for connecting individual cable cores in 3-way junctions.

The proposed robotic end-effector is equipped with a cable feeding mechanism and it
can press-fit the electrical cables into narrow channels created in concrete pre-fabricated
walls. The end-effector shows reliable and repeatable operation. The research also presents
two types of connector designs that can facilitate the connection of the cable cores in the
junctions of pre-fabricated walls. The installation of connectors is based on a machine
vision framework implemented in MATLAB. The machine vision framework can identify
the colours of cables and locate the cables.

Robot programming and path planning relied on kinaesthetic teaching. The results showed
the speed of routing using robotic arms far exceeds manual routing.
